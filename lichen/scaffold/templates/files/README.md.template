🌿 Lichen Stack

Lichen Stack is a minimal event-driven desktop application architecture built around:

-   🦀 Tauri — lightweight Rust-based desktop UI
-   🐍 Python — backend services and logic
-   🧵 NATS — messaging layer for pub/sub communication

🔧 Features

-   Event-driven backend service architecture
-   WebSocket streaming to the Tauri UI
-   Shared binaries and configs for bundled production builds
-   Support for building offline-native local AI tools (e.g. LLM inference, RAG, crawlers)

🚀 Goals
Lichen is designed as a reusable starter stack for building local-first tools,
experiments, and AI-driven workflows with full control over the execution environment.
It aims to be simple, powerful, and easily extendable.
